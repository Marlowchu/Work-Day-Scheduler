For this assignment I had to use bootstrap and the existing CSS code to create the timeblocks and to make site responsive.

I had to create the logic in javascript to meet the functionality outlined in the acceptance criteria.

First I learned about the Moment.js library. I needed this to display the current day at the top of the calendar. My next step was to create the logic for the different timeblock colors. I created functions to test if the current time was past future or currently the time in each timeblock. depending on the outcome is what determines the timeblock color. 

The next step was to save the input typed into the text boxes when the save button was clicked. The infomation is saved in local storage in order to keep the values after a refresh.
